Goals:

Completely unified testing.  The ability to run tests and aggregate their
results regardless of how the test is implemented, (perl, parrot, hll, etc.)
HTML Reports should function much as we have now, but with the additional
ability to look at results across versions to check when tests were injected.

Steps:

1) Make TAP::Harness run top level (t/harness) tests cleanly with no shebang issues.

2) Make TAP::Harness run top level and language harnesses cleanly, regardless of
   test implementation.

3) Add processing of the output of Configure --test.

4) Smolder investigation

5) Final HTML report work
