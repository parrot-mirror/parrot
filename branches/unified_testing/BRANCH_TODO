Goals:

Completely unified testing.  The ability to run tests and aggregate their
results regardless of how the test is implemented, (perl, parrot, hll, etc.)
HTML Reports should function much as we have now, but with the additional
ability to look at results across versions to check when tests were injected.

This will be done with a combination of Makefile and TAP::Harness 3.0 code.

Each HLL is expected to run its tests inside of its own directory.  languages/Makefile
will be changed to do this, instead of what it does now with gathering a list
of files to run via a command line switch.

Steps:

1) Make TAP::Harness run top level (t/harness) tests cleanly with no shebang issues.
    DONE: Make a competing harness based on TAP::Harness 3.0 and App::Prove
    DONE: Figure out a way to use existing prove switches AND t/harness switches at the same time
        (Getopt::Long and --)

2) Make TAP::Harness run top level and language harnesses cleanly, regardless of
   test implementation.
    Fix shebang line issues in tests

    *) Parrot::Test::HLL.pm should be local to the language.

3) Write a coding standard test to make sure that t/* tests call out a location
   independent parrot/interpreter.

4) Extend coding standard to cover language level tests.

5) Add processing of the output of Configure --test.

6) Smolder investigation

7) Final HTML report work

=head1 NAME

Parrot::TAP::Harness - a TAP::Harness subclass

=head1 USAGE

  runtests --harness Parrot::TAP::Harness -r t languages/

Actually, it is called 'prove' now, but you'll probably want a runtests
symlink until things settle-down a bit.

=head1 ABOUT

This is a first-crack with input from Colin Kuskie and Allison Randal.
Many things still need to happen on both the TAP::Harness and parrot
fronts.

Contact Eric Wilhelm and/or the TAP::Parser mailing list with questions.

=head1 TAP::Harness/Test::Harness

TAP::Harness is replacing Test::Harness.  At this point, simply using
the new version of Test::Harness may not work, so download the tree,
delete lib/Test/Harness.pm, rename bin/prove to bin/runtests, then
install.

=begin Overview

=head1 How to run the tests?

Answer:  shebang line

=head1 What tests to run?

The logic of which tests to run is quite spread-out at the moment.
Further, it is not clear whether a no-run test is omitted because of a
limitation of the harness or a genuine (too slow, not done, etc) reason.

Still needs an implementation detail.  Might involve something like
calling each harness with --files argument (though that seems to not
work from the root atm.)

Ultimately, parrot should work toward organizing tests in such a way
that collecting information on what to run/not-run is unnecessary.

=head1 What *not* to run?

The --files scheme is a whitelist, should there be a blacklist?

=head1 Where am I?

The "current directory" thing is an issue for parrot in general, but
currently a trouble spot for this .pm file in particular.

=end Overview

=begin observations

=head1 t/harness files

=head2 multiple vs single harness/summary

Each t/harness wants to be the one to call runtests().  This makes it
difficult to run all of the tests at once (and impossible (sort of) to
mix parrot/perl5 exec.)

Aside:  The perl 5 interpreter will run whatever is on the shebang line,
but this just leads to "unrecognized argument" when it tries to pass -I
and etc.  This is tempting, but unworkable in the long run.

=head3 spooling

A possible answer to the multiple-harnesses issue is the
PERL_TEST_HARNESS_DUMP_TAP environment variable.  We could run all of
the tests with each t/harness, then re-aggregate them all together from
the raw tap in the spool directory.

With the Test::Harness 2.99_01 code, this will work with no
modifications.

=head2 --files arguments

That might still be useful, and should maybe be supported everywhere
(plus without too much $PWD assumption.)

E.g. t/harness

  my $print_files = grep { $_ eq '--files' } @ARGV;
  @ARGV = grep { $_ ne '--files' } @ARGV;
  ...
  if($print_files) {
      print join("\n", @tests), "\n";
      exit;
  }

=head2 languages/t/harness

This does not use Parrot::Test::Harness::runtests(), and therefore
cannot run multiple interpreters.

=head2 --gc-debug

TEST_PROG_ARGS is not HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES.  This means subprocess
parrot runs see the --gc-debug, but not *.t files which are run as
`parrot ... foo.t`.

=end observations

=begin notes

=head1 Caveats

=head2 @INC for --harness

This file has to live in './Parrot/TAP/Harness.pm'.  Parrot should
probably just have their own runtests file, but the TAP::Harness 'prove'
is not subclassable (yet.)

=head2 --archive option not working

That is a TAP::Harness API bug.  TAP::Harness::Archive also wants to be
a TAP::Harness subclass (well, *the* TAP::Harness subclass.)  We also
want to be that subclass.  This ends in @ISA jealousy, spite, etc.

=head2 what tests?

Unless every .t file is 'ok to test', straight '-r t' usage will break.

One possibile workaround, but kind of ugly:

  prove --harness Parrot::TAP::Harness \
    $(perl t/harness --files) \
    $(perl languages/t/harness --files) \
    $(perl languages/perl6/t/harness --files)

=head2 Shebang .pbc

This allows sloppy shebang lines, and probably should not.

=end notes

=begin recommendations

Here's roughly what we decided parrot should work toward.  It is of
course weighted by "what Eric thinks" and "what Eric does not know yet."

=head1 Consistent Shebang Lines

The shebang should always be "#!parrot" for pir, and the bare pbc name
for any hosted language (e.g. "#!perl6".)

Aside: this forces the issue of how 'parrot' switches (-G) are ferried
across from the compiler.

=head1 Organized Tests

Either all of the tests (recursively) in any t/ are always run or
something declarative should be extracted from the --files thing (or
the --files thing should be made more robust and consistent.)

Secondary and 'meta' tests should probably just find a home in
xt/standards, xt/exhaustive, etc.  Adding flags to a custom prove could
easily support this (see also:  TAP::Parser is probably heading this
direction anyway.)

=head1 Solve $PWD Issues

These need to be solved both on the TAP::Harness front (WRT subclassing)
and in the parrot .t files.
