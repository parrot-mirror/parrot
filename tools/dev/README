README for tools/dev/

This directory is intended to hold programs, templates and configuration files
found useful by Parrot developed other than those (a) invoked by the default
'make' target ('make all'), with or without command-line options, during the
Parrot build process; or (b) invoked by 'make install' or 'make install-dev'.
