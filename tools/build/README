README for tools/build/

This directory is intended to hold programs, templates and configuration files
invoked by the default 'make' target ('make all'), with or without
command-line options, during the Parrot build process.

Programs, templates and configuration files invoked by 'make install' or
'make install-dev' should be placed in tools/release/.

Other things being equal, programs, templates and configuration files invoked
by all other 'make' targets (e.g., 'make headerizer') should be placed in
tools/dev/.
