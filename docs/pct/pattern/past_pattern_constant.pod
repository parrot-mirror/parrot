=head1 NAME

PAST::Pattern::Constant - A PAST::Pattern subclass for exact matching of constants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A PAST::Pattern::Constant matches objects that are equal to(according to the is_equal vtable) its
value.

=head1 PAST::Pattern::Constant is PAST::Pattern

A PAST::Pattern::Constant contains a constant value. This constant value specifies what objects the
pattern matches. The pattern matches if the is_equal vtable of the value produces a true result
when called with the object to be matched.

PAST::Pattern::patternize produces a PAST::Pattern::Constant when called with an object which
neither has an ACCEPTS method nor provides the invokable role.

=head2 Attributes

=over 4

=item value

The value attribute holds the constant value that must be equal to any matching objects. If the
value lacks an is_equal vtable, the ACCEPTSEXACTLY method will throw an exception.

=over 4

=item new(value)

Creates a PAST::Pattern::Constant with value as its constant target value.

=item value([new_value])

If new_value is provided, set the value attribute of the pattern to new_value. Otherwise, return the
current value of the value attribute.

=item ACCEPTSEXACTLY(node)

Used internally by the inherited ACCEPTS method to determine whether a node exactly matches the
pattern.
