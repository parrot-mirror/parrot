=head1 NAME

Tree::Pattern::Any - Match any of a list of patterns.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tree::Pattern::Any patterns match any object that matches any of their
subpatterns, similar to Perl 6's junctions.

Unlike Perl 6 junctions, they currently operate sequentially from their first
child to their last.

As soon as any subpattern has matches, its result is returned.
